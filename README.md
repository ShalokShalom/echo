# Echo

## Introduction  

**Echo** is a new game engine, which used more industry-standard of nowadays for game development. This new design concept makes the engine simpler to use and more powerful.

## Build
### [Editor]   
[How to Compile "Echo Engine" From Source Code](https://github.com/timi-liuliang/echo/wiki/Compile-Echo-From-Source-Code)

### [App]   

## Features

### Easy Concept  
Scene manager is easy, No Entiy, No GameObject, No Component, No Prefab. Only Node and NodeTree.

###  Highly Efficient Workflow

### Multi-Platform Support  
iOS Android Html5 Windows Mac Linux Steam  

### New Industry Standard Support
gLtf2.0, Vulkan, Metal, Pbr, Real time ray tracing.

### 2D And 3D Seamless Transition Â 
Every node can be 2d or 3d. The core difference is the camera and the unit the node use. So you can just switch a node to 2d or 3d easily.

### Easy To Program  
Mostly, you'll use Lua as your main programming language. and also can also use C++ directly. The design of our node tree makes the Lua logic code more easy to write. And the embedded Lua editor and the embedded documents help you to write code in the echo editor directly.   
Except for Lua, You can also choose use embedded Scratch as the main development language. This is a type of visual script inspired by [MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu/). In the Echo engine is Scratch based on Lua, when running the app, It'll convert to Lua and make sure it's good both to merge and will run efficent..   
If you really like other types of script language, you can tell us, or you can support it by modifying the c++ code directly.

### Data Flow Programming Based ShaderEditor
Programming visualization is a very important concept for non-programmers and with the help of the DataFlowProgramming framework [nodeeditor](https://github.com/paceholder/nodeeditor), shader programming becomes easier to understand.

### Render Pipeline Visualization (Developing)
Inspired by [CI|CD pipeline](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cicd-pipeline), we decided make a render pipeline editor, so that not only programmers, but everyone can configure the engine render process.   
1. Forward Rendering?   
2. Deferred Shading?    
3. Forward+ (Tiled Forward Rendering)?
Try config it by your needs.

### Configurable Module   
Most of the engine's Functionality was implemented by configurable modules. that means when you release your app, you can just choose the module you really need. Which makes your app smaller in size and more efficiently running.

### Animate Everything   
With Timeline, you can animate everything. You can not only animate any Object's (Node, Setting, Res) property. But also you can call any Object's function.

### Channel References
You can compute the value of one property based on the value of another property, possibly on a different node. This lets you duplicate values, or makes values relative to other values, and have Echo automatically update them whenever they change.

### Open Source  
Echo is licensed under the MIT license. You can just do what you want as you wish.
